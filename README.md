A Minesweeper game in a Python Minecraft engine

## Minecraft Game Engine

This project was built into an existing open source Minecraft game. The Minecraft engine is written entirely in Python using the pyglet package. It consists of 900 lines of Python code in a single file - an exemplar project for concise and effective code.

## What I have added

All the game logic for minesweeper was written from scratch. The engine was modified to add actions to play miesweeper and to use minesweeper textures.

## How to run

After cloning the repository - navigate to the root folder in a command prompt terminal, run $pip install requirments (.txt), run $python minecraftsweeper
