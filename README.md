# minecraftsweeper
A Minesweeper game in a Python Minecraft engine

## The minecraft game engine

This project was built into an existing open source minecraft game. (link)) The minecraft engine is written entirely in Python using the pyglet package. It consists of 900 lines of Python code in a single file - an exemplar project for concise and effective code.

## What I have added

All the game logic for minesweeper was written from scratch. Other additions include the game menu at start up and the explosion effects on mine activation.

## How to run

After cloning the repository - navigate to the root folder in a command prompt terminal, run $pip install requirments (.txt), run $python minecraftsweeper
